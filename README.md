# BlindtestGenerator

Objective of this project is to be able to generate "blindtest type" vid√©os from a playlist. 
a blindtest is a serie of short 20 seconds clips with a blackscreen and only an audio track playing, the goal is to guess which song is being played. After X seconds of playing
The answer is then displayed. 
Currently it only takes a youtube playlist and turns it into a chain of 20 seconds "guessing clips" and 7 seconds of answers. 

The next goal is to use Pychorus to detect different parts of songs and use them depending on the difficulty.

After this, the goal would be to support spotify/soundcloud/deezer playlists and be able to generate itself a blindtest by giving it different criteria like Year, genre etc...
